title: Local man faces uncertain future after failing to see "must see" film
---

LEEDS. Local man Philip Butterworth, 41, was tonight facing a difficult future after a "must see" film left local cinemas before he was able to see it. Despite being repeatedly told by his partner, friends, work colleagues and national newspapers that the film was a "must see", Butterworth, 38, today told reporters today that "to be honest, I'd forgotten it was on".

While Butterworth accepted that the film "looked like it might not be too bad", when offered the chance to see the movie, Butterworth chose to stay at home and play video games instead, saying that he "didn't really fancy going to the cinema", adding that he was "a bit knackered".

This is, of course, not the first time that Butterworth has flirted with danger, having previously failed to read a "must read" book and repeatedly failed to watch "must see" programmes on television.
