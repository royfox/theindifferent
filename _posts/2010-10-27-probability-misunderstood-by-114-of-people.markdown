title: Probability misunderstood by 114% of people

SHROPSHIRE. At least 114% of British citizens have no understanding of simple probability, new research published today reveals. A study undertaken by Professor Gordon Delicious, Professor of Statistical Nonsense at the University of Shropshire, looked at how well ordinary people coped with GCSE level mathematical concepts.

"The results are pretty damning", Professor Delicious explained today. "37% of people were unable to correctly estimate the probability of rolling snake eyes with two fair dice. 54% didn't understand how to handle probabilities of conditional events, and 23% couldn't understand concepts of permutations and combinations. In total that gives up a surprising 114% who have made at least one kind of basic error".

When asked why 69 million of Brtain's 61 million iinhabitants were unable to perform the tasks, Professor Delicious suggested that education was to blame. "At least 34 children in every class of 30 are failing to learn how to interpret numbers correctly. I think you will agree that is pretty alarming."
