RUSSIA.  Following a high profile and relentless disambiguation campaign, Russian website comparethemeerkat.com has now become the world's fifth most popular destination for users seeking to compare meerkats. Though the advertisements initially started to help redirect lost Internet users looking to compare car insurance policies, Compare The Meerkat has now itself started to grow in popularity - a welcome surprise to founder Alexandr Orlov.

"We started the adverts because we were seeing lots people looking for car insurance", Orlov explained. "It was all pretty altruistic to begin with - I wanted to use some of my money for good so I decided to help clarify the confusion. We've seen a real boost in our own traffic, though - it's unexpected but really pleasing."
