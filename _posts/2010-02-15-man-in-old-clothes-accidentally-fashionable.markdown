LONDON. A mature student, well known amongst his friends for never bothering to buy new clothes, became briefly fashionable today after he accidentally put together a new season outfit from some old clothes he found lying around. Dave Barry, 43, admitted he never really cares what he is wearing, adding that he was "both surprised and delighted" to learn that some of his crappy old clothes had become trendy since he last wore them.

Fashion experts believe that today's unexpected bout of trendiness is becoming increasingly common. "Fashion tends to go in cycles", fashion journalist Trisha Tomkins explained. "Things that were once fashionable tend to become fashionable again, so it stands to reason that if you never change your clothes, you'll be fashionable for a short while every twenty or thirty years."
