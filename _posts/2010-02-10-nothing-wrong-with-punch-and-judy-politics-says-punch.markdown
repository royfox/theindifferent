title: Nothing wrong with Punch and Judy politics, says Punch
---

Childrens entertainer Punch today leapt to the defense of so called "Punch and Judy politics", insisting it had been "unfairly maligned" by opponents trying to discredit him ahead of the general election in May. Speaking in South London, where he is contesting the Croydon North seat on behalf of the Seaside Puppet Party, Punch insisted that Punch And Just politics was exactly what the country needed to help it out of the current ecomomic downturn.

"Some people may call it Punch and Judy politics, but to my wife Judy and I it is more than that. It's our way of life,"  Punch explained. "Whenever disputes need to be resolved, the most effective way is nearly always to whack someone on the head for the entertainment of others. Laughter and visual comedy are a sound basis for a system of goverment."

At today's press conference Punch also unveiled his manifesto for the forthcoming election. Key policies objectives include telling jokes, whacking people with a stick and generally making everyone "Pleased as Punch".
