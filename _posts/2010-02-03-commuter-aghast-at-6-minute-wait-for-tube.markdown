LONDON. A regular rush hour commuter was left open-mouthed earlier today, after learning the next tube would not arrive at the platform for 6 minutes. Molly Jones, 29, was standing on the northbound Victoria Line platform at Green Park when she received the terrible news. "6 minutes is ridiculous", Jones told reporters. "1 or 2 minutes is totally fine; 3 or 4 is disappointing; I've heard stories of 5 minutes before but 6 minutes is unprecedented. I didn't even have a book or iPod with me. I was forced to just stare into space and got a little bit bored".

The delay added as much as five minutes to Jones' regular 50 minute commute, meaning that she only arrived at work five minutes early, rather than her usual ten.
