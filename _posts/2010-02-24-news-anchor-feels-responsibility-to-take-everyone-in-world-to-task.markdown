LONDON. A television news anchor from London feels a deep personal responsibility to ask everyone in the entire world tough questions, it was revealed today. In a frank interview with himself, John Gator, 57, made the admission after he backed himself into a corner with an uncomfortable line of questioning.

"I always have to challenge everything anyone says", Gator explained. "It's my duty as a journalist. Why is the coffee pot empty? Who in power allowed that to happen? What is the future for that coffee pot? The public have a right to know the answers".

Gator also questioned himself on the subject of his private life, saying "the public have a right to know who their news anchor really is". Gator was unrepentant, however, defending his recent decisions, including accusing his friends of "flip-flopping" for not turning up to the pub when they said they would and asking his son if he considered his position "untenable" after he forgot his father's birthday. "Whenever anyone says anything, anything at all, it must be challenged", Gator told viewers. "People needs to learn that if they ever make mistakes, everyone in the world will know."
