BRIXTON. An office worker today celebrated on the inside after overtaking eight fellow cyclists on a busy uphill road in South London. Tom Johnson, 32, was the first of the group of eight unconnected commuters to reach the top of Brixton Hill, and revealed that while it may have looked easy, a lot of effort was involved.

"My heart was beating pretty hard, but it's important to look relaxed when you overtake people," Johnson explained. " You can't let them know that you're racing them. But everybody races sometimes."

Johnson's victory was all the more impressive given the calibre of the opposition, which included a woman on a shopping bike, a couple of teenagers, and a guy wearing lycra riding what looked like an a pretty expensive road bike. "It was particularly sweet to beat that guy", Johnson added. "He looks pretty fast but he made a right mess of the traffic lights, and that cost him dear".
