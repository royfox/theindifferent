LONDON. A valiant but short lived attempt to save money and eat more healthily came to an end today when a local man officially ended his stint of preparing healthy lunches, returning instead to his customary ritual of selecting a packaged sandwich at random from the supermarket across the street from his office.

John Lahm, 27, from East Dulwich, South London, made the dramatic U-Turn only five days after telling friends and colleagues that he was going to make nutritious packed lunches "every day from now on". While the extract reason for the humilating climbdown is still shrouded in mystery, sources closes to Lahm suggest that that laziness, a lack of inspiration, an absence of good ingredients in the house and a stonking hangover may all contributed to his decision.

"He was really into it at first", Lahm's girlfriend Rachel Jones, 24, said today. "He made really nice sandwiches for himself, and one day he even cooked a whole meal the night before work and took it into work to microwave the next day. I just don't know what happened".

Critics of Mr. Lahm point out that this is not the first time he has failed to deliver on a promise made to himself â€“ in fact his plans to "learn Mandarin", "really get fit" and "find my true vocation" all met with a similar fate.
