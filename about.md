The Indifferent is a fiercely ambivalent newspaper that has been covering hardly any aspects of the news since 2010. We were writing fake news before it was cool. 

The Indifferent may contain offensive material, dangling modifiers, bad grammar, spelling mistakes, and if we are very, lucky, satire. Due to its content, it should not be read by anybody.
